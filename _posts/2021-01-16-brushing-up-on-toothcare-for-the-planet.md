About two weeks ago I received the best of news from my annual dentist appointment: my teeth are quite healthy, and my flossing habits are up to par. This was some pretty exciting news, but not because I am a fully-fledged dental hygiene nerd – this good news from the dentist’s office confirmed that the plastic-free dental care routine that I developed was working for both my teeth and for the planet! So, with that little anecdote, welcome to the tooth-edition of *a crumb*! 

It can be intimidating to switch away from a product or routine that you have used all your life. After all, humans are definitely creatures of habit. I feel like this is the reason that many changes in the world, environmental or not, are slow to come. The status quo is oftentimes quite convenient and easy for us to stick to. We all grew up using plastic toothbrushes and accepting the little takeaway baggie filled with travel-sized dental products from our annual tooth cleaning appointment. What’s so wrong with this dental default?

Well, it turns out that there is lots of plastic waste on the other end of conventional tooth care habits. National Geographic reports that in the US, over [1 billion plastic toothbrushes](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/story-of-plastic-toothbrushes) are thrown away each year, which compound as million pounds of waste in our environment. Toothpaste tubes are [rarely recyclable](https://www.recyclenow.com/what-to-do-with/plastic-tubes), compounding the tooth-associated plastic waste. Floss takes less time to break down than conventional plastics, but every yard of that floss that you do or do not use (let’s be honest, flossing is a hard habit to take up) ends up right alongside toothbrush and toothpaste waste, inspiring beach clean-ups and ocean awareness worldwide.

The good news is that there are a plethora of creative solutions for plastic waste created from keeping our teeth healthy and clean! For starters, there is the classic **bamboo toothbrush**. This is definitely a hallmark piece in the millennial environmentalist toolbox, but I promise that it is worth the switch! I have never been particularly picky about the bristles or colors of my toothbrush, so from all I can tell, the bamboo toothbrush functions just the same as any old conventional toothbrush. Depending on the brand of bamboo brush, you can either compost the whole thing, snap off the head and compost the handle, or remove the bristles by soaking in hot water and then composting the wood portion. I will remind you that I have been using bamboo toothbrushes for a couple years now, and the dentists keep telling me that my teeth are in good shape, so they really do the job. Plus, when it comes to buying a bamboo toothbrush, they are becoming much more mainstream, so finding them outside of your local crunchy supermarket or Co-op is only getting easier by the day. Not to mention the prices are pretty comparable!

The next step that I took in my revised, plastic-free toothcare routine was to move away from plastic-swathed floss. Both the container and the floss itself is usually plastic, and as far as I can tell the floss container is not conducive to simple recycling. Ultimately, if you get as far as inspiring yourself to floss, it all ends up in the trash as a plastic heap. The floss picks can be even worse if used on a daily basis, because they contribute way more plastic to the trash than traditional string floss does. But do not worry, creative people in the dental products world have offered us a plastic-free flossing solution – **compostable floss** made from natural fibers, rather than plastic! Now, for bamboo toothbrushes there was not much of a significant price difference, but I will warn you here that the difference in price is more noticeable between flosses. I tend towards purchasing [Dr. Tung’s activated charcoal floss](https://drtungs.com/) – the outer packaging is recyclable cardboard and the floss itself is compostable. There is no guilt in my flossing routine, thanks to this discovery!

Lastly, I am here to nudge you towards giving **toothpaste tablets** a try. Hear me out, I know that this is a strange concept, as it is probably the part of my plastic-free toothcare that strays the most from normalcy. Essentially toothpaste tablets are a compressed toothpaste formula that you pop into your mouth, chew up a little, and then you start brushing. From my experience, one thing you should know about toothpaste tabs is that they do not lend the same brushing experience as conventional toothpaste. There’s less foaming and no overwhelming sweet minty flavor, but I was never much of a fan of that anyways. However, as I said before, they operate in the same way and keep your teeth clean and healthy – you can take my dentist’s word on that!

I purchased my current toothpaste tabs at a local bulk store in Alexandria, VA called [Mason & Greens](https://www.masonandgreens.com/), and have been using these tabs for about five months now. They are from the company [Georganics](https://georganics.com/collections/natural-toothpaste), and they have an awesome assortment of plastic-free dental products and natural toothpastes on their website (and lots of good reviews too). Similar to the plastic-free floss, they are a bit pricier when compared to normal toothpaste, but toothpaste tubes are so hard to recycle and more often than not end up in the trash (and then our landscapes and oceans!). The particular store that I purchased from allowed me to use my own container, so I got them completely plastic free. I have seen options to purchase toothpaste tabs in paper bags and in glass jars, both in stores and online, so it is much easier to avoid plastic with this conventional toothpaste alternative. I really urge you to give it a try – it’s a different experience as I said, but the benefits to the environment are worth the price tag and a great reason to explore something new!

I see more and more ads for these environmentally friendly alternatives for hygienic and beauty products. Although deodorant stones (or crystal deodorants) are not within the realm of toothcare, I do have to give them a quick plug for being another plastic-free personal hygiene measure that I adore! 

Do you have any other environmentally friendly or plastic-free toothcare habits? Share them in the comments below! I encourage you to take a step out of your comfort zone and give one of these products a try – you’ll be surprised how simple and rewarding ‘brushing for the planet’ can be.
