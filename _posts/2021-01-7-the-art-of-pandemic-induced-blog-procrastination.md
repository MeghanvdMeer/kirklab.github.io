The life narrative of everyone I speak with these days seems to go about the same way – life creeps by at a confusingly ‘fast but at the same time slow’ pace, and noticeable changes are scant. Plans are cancelled. Motivation plummeted back in March and has yet to make a full recovery. Waking up 5 minutes before a Zoom meeting to be conducted at the dining room table in your pajamas is convenient and all, but office banter is deeply missed and a proper desk chair would do wonders right about now. 

Along with these ups and downs, I have noticed my thoughts around sustainable living to be especially dismal. With the pandemic came a germ-phobia that skipped many levels, settling now at ‘hyper-hyper-hyper-hyper… hyper-aware’. Some stores went back on plastic bag bans they had implemented just a summer or two ago. As early as March, I started noticing masks and latex gloves as prominent litter on the streets. Takeaway food is now the safest option in many places, yet Styrofoam and abundant plastic utensil sets have yet to be unpaired from the to-go world. Not to mention, there is a a huge influx of medical waste on the other end of all COVID-related matters and testing. The wasteful practices go on and on, with good and cautious reason of course, but it is easy to see that sustainable progress has backslid a substantial amount as 2020 unfolded.

As mentioned earlier, motivation has also been at a low, generally speaking and also in particular regard to my motivation with writing for a crumb. Part of it was a gamble of how my ‘free-time’ was to be spent – especially during the fall semester (my first as a PhD student), the last thing I wanted to sign myself up for was more computer time, at the screen writing for more hours. To be completely transparent, the majority of the reason was housed in how thinking about sustainable living as the pandemic unfolded brought on major depression, especially when the local food Co-op closed, rendering my bulk shopping methods as a germ haven (plastic-free food, it turns out, was the key to a huge part of my sanity). It seemed like the plastic-free movement slid to a halt in a matter of days – I don’t even know how to reckon with the emotions that are brought on when my reusable coffee cup now accompanies a negative social stigma (it used to mean I was earth-aware, not a local coffeeshop COVID super spreader – I swear!). The root of society’s environmental problems is that there is little to no infrastructure in which a sustainable future can be built upon. From the little infrastructure that I had installed into my day-to-day routines, I became overwhelmed with how much of it evaporated it as COVID swept through our lives. 

But then the other day I received this text message:

And suddenly the burden of the pandemic and environmental depression lifted just a little bit, enough to let me see the point of all of these conversations, thoughts, and blog posts in a pandemic world or in a normal world. We will probably always struggle to perfect the art of sustainable living. As I said before, the infrastructure of our day-to-day lives prevents opportunities and equity across all of our efforts – from healthy, plastic-free food to our choice of where energy is sourced from. If we set that reality aside and recognize that there is huge accomplishment in changing little things, here and there, and thus by giving the ripple effect a fighting chance, there is no need to be overwhelmed or discouraged. To live sustainably means a million different things, but the more that we share ideas and put names and actions to those million things, we can begin to scatter the seeds of a more sustainable future outside of our own practices, our own gardens that we tend to each day. 

It may seem silly that I absolutely lit up with inspiration at the knowledge one of my dearest college friends took up a sustainable habit that I held close to my heart. But I think it is a true testament to the fact that you really can impact those around you, and tune a couple more people in to the wavelength that environmental-minded folks are getting at. 

This is why I write this blog, for little moments where people realize that they, too, can join in on this movement. Friends who report back with their sustainability wins of the week. Parents who send a text when they use a reusable produce bag I gifted a while back. Rewarding conversations with others who have the same goals, but have the experience of a different path that I and others too can glean so much from. 

In receiving this text, I started to reflect on my habits over quarantine, and how when I thought there was nothing but a dismal situation to write about, the content is actually plentiful! Sure, in some ways I have switched away from my tried-and-true routines (such as plastic-free and bulk food shopping), but my lifestyle has swayed to accompany other sustainable measures. From placing and emphasis on vegan cooking to experience-themed Christmas gifts to (multiple) attempts at a homemade kombucha SCOBY, there is plenty of blog content! I guess I just didn’t see it until I remembered the importance of little inspirations that pop up here and there. 

So, thank you to my best friend, who picked up bamboo utensils and ruminated a bit on her plastic use. You have inspired me, just as I hope to give back and inspire readers of *a crumb* to venture out and give a new thing a try, in the name of preserving the endless gift of our natural environment.
