Loose-leaf tea is one of my favorite zero-waste tips – not only can you avoid unnecessary plastic waste with this habit, but the tea itself turns out even tastier! Like most crops, tea cultivation can have a negative effect on the environment when grown on the industrial level. Of course, there are more and less sustainable ways of growing tea, but buying Fairtrade certified tea is always a good place to start. This ensures that growers are compensated with fair prices and living wages for their product. Family-owned tea companies or local producers are also best to support, as a smaller operation is less likely to lead to high rates of land use conversion, overconsumption of resources, pollution of aquifers, and so on. Although, there are some major industry brands that are dedicated to low environmental impact and sustainable harvest methods.

Information about a company’s dedication to sustainable growing practices can be found out from individual websites and mission statements. Although, I found that some companies are more straightforward than others in communicating their sustainability commitments. After doing research for this article, I learned some surprising things about the tea industry, including the fact that not all tea bags are compostable!  I have always been a strong proponent of composting tea bags, but it turns out that the deceptively ‘natural’ or biodegradable look of tea bags can actually contain plastic. It is important that if you use tea bags, you check the company’s mission statement to see whether or not their tea bags are biodegradable. Compostability is dependent on the brand – I found that popular companies such as Celestial Seasonings, Mighty Leaf, Numi, Republic of Tea, Stash, and Yogi Tea bags can all be composted. For other brands, they likely use polypropylene in their tea bags, oftentimes used in the sealing process.  It is best to look for bags that are stitched together rather than heat-sealed, because the latter oftentimes implies that a plastic was used. However, by drinking loose-leaf and switching out for tea bags all together, you can avoid this issue entirely!

Side note: individual tea sachets are also a small environmental disaster – they cannot be recycled the majority of the time. Sachets are usually lined with plastic to ensure freshness, or they are a combination of paper and foil that is difficult to separate and successfully recycle. Another compelling reason to make the switch to loose-leaf tea! 

Tea experts (apparently that profession exists!) claim that loose-leaf tea has a more complex, multidimensional flavor, and I am sure that there is some kind of science or studies that support this steeping method. I am no connoisseur of tea, but I definitely have come to enjoy the taste of loose-leaf much more than your average tea bag. Another benefit is that you get the full leaf – oftentimes in tea bags you are just getting tea ‘dust’ which does not bring on the full-bodied flavour that you are after!

For Christmas last year, I was gifted a beautiful cast iron tea pot which is perfect for steeping loose-leaf tea. It has a little metal basket where you place a teaspoon or two of tea leaves, then pour boiling water over the top and let steep for however long your please. The tea pot even came with tiny little tea cups that are the absolute cutest, and I love to bring them out when hosting guests or on the rare occasion that I feel fancy and proper. These steeping pots are very common and can be found both on the internet or at local culinary stores. Each morning before class I boil my water in the kettle, measure out the leaves, let it steep while I cook my breakfast, and the timing is then perfect! I pour out a cup to go with my toast, and then I pour the rest into my to-go mug for another cup when I get to class.

Additionally, there are smaller tea steepers and infusers that are great for tea on the go. I have two different kinds, and both of them are stainless steel and fit in my to-go mug. Simply scoop up some tea in the steeper and pour  water over it on your way out of the house – it couldn’t be any simpler! When I get home from class, the tea leaves get emptied straight into my compost container. I have no reason to worry about plastic contamination, and the whole ritual is zero-waste!

I purchase refills of loose-leaf tea from both the CO-OP and from the local Wegmans. I can bring refillable bags or containers to both stores, and switch up varieties of tea with each trip to the grocery store. The CO-OP has lots of sustainable, Fairtrade, and organic options, so that is usually my first pick over Wegmans. However, Wegmans still has a fair variety of organic tea options.

I remember when I set intention to convert to loose-leaf tea in my zero-waste journey, the convenience of tea bags became quite apparent. And this is exactly their purpose - rip open a sachet and you have the perfect about of tea that can be tossed right into your hot water. I thought that I would need to make more time in my morning routine to accommodate this more involved method of tea-steeping, but it turns out that it takes just about the same amount of time! The only time-consuming step that I have found is emptying out the used leaves into the compost and then rinsing the steepers. To me, that is a fair price to pay for plastic-free cups of tea that taste better, keep me going throughout the day, and never fail to make me cozy!
