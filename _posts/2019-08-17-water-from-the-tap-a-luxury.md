One of the first lessons in life is that food, water, and shelter are the three essentials for human survival. You can go without shelter for moderate periods of time (although it does make life much more enjoyable, not to mention more comfortable), you can survive approximately 30 to 40 days without food, and you will die within a week of going without water (however the record is allegedly 18 days, but most people choose not to test this limit). As you can see, water by all means is absolutely the most critical of our human needs. 

I take water for granted, and in the United States we can rely upon almost any faucet for a safe lap of hydration. Considering the whole scope of the country, we are incredibly lucky to have this resource at our disposal. Widespread potable water access in public places has allowed for our society to adopt sustainable habits such as carrying around a refillable bottle. This may seem basic and obvious, well, because it is basic and obvious. This is almost a rule of our nation; you more or less expect to have clean and safe water.

Imagine if you had to think twice before dipping your head down to drink from a water fountain. Or if the fountain ceased to exist at all. Or if you had to walk an hours return trip to find semi-safe water, just boil it a handful of times to be brought to minimum drinking standards. Pretty difficult to imagine, isn’t it? I know that for myself I cannot picture this scenario. Accessible drinking water is a norm of our society – it is an anticipated and expected resource.

Many nations live completely without the luxury of safe water. I recently spent a week travelling in Indonesia where I was able to experience life without the convenience of clean drinking water at every turn. My travels allowed me to reflect on what it means for a country to have infrastructure catering to the hydration needs of its people, and in addition how this privilege is reflected in a nation’s environmental footprint.

I would like to preface this discussion by noting that up until my travels, I have fervently boycotted bottled water. I loathe bottled water. I find it rather ridiculous in concept, particularly in places where the tap water is nothing but safe to drink. That being said, I have always lived in locations where the aquifers are bountiful, and waterlines are sufficient for transport. Water is water, and claims that bottled water ‘tastes better’ is just ludicrous to me, and water from the tap is essentially free (especially when you are a kid and don’t have to pay the bills). Just kidding. I pay a water bill now, and I can assure you that it is not free. But you get the gist.

In just one week travelling in Indonesia and I had consumed more plastic water bottles than I most likely have in the last ten years of my life. I was going through about two bottles, a couple litres worth, every day as I hiked and explored around. It was not because I couldn’t locate a bottle refill station (although that is true – the only one I saw for the entire trip was located in the airport) - it was because water from the tap was simply unsafe to drink. 

So, what does a country like Indonesia have to fall back on? Bottled water. In fact, 15.7 billion litres of it, in the year of 2009. Bottled water consumption in this country is second only to China, and predictably the countries go 1-2 for contributions of plastic pollution – between 1.15 and 2.41 million tonnes contaminates our natural systems each year, and Indonesia is responsible for 200,000 tonnes of that estimate. 

Dependence on bottled water is a multifaceted issue, rooted in a lack of infrastructure, insufficient money available to provide or build rainwater collection tanks, and challenges to transport and dispersal of said resources - the list goes on and on.  Even for a commodity as simple as water, coordinated, unified, well-funded efforts are critical to bringing drinking water to communities. Where these characteristics are absent, the burden largely falls on the poor and unprivileged of the world. While plastic pollution may be churned out of regions such as Indonesia and China, wealth disparities and failure to implement leadership seem to be at the root of the issue.

In Indonesia, extra caution surrounds drinking from the tap. Visitors and locals alike are content with buying bottled water, and you can purchase 1.5L for 10k rupiah – about $00.70 USD. Bottled water consumption expands in tandem with Indonesia’s increasing population. As a result, huge profits are to be made by bottling companies, such as Aqua, the country’s lead supplier. I was riddled with guilt as I purchased each bottle, but there was no other option, unless I wanted to spend my holiday with a stomach ache and a fair bit of yacking up my food. Not to mention, in the tropical region in which Indonesia finds itself, sustained water consumption is of the essence. Roadside signs periodically make public service announcements to visitors, preaching the necessity of hydration. Great public health work, albeit in a non-sustainable way when your one-stop-shop for water comes out of a single use plastic bottle.

This issue extends further than simply a dependency on single use plastics for obtaining one of the basics of human life. Plastic pollution is everywhere in Indonesia. I witnessed people burning plastic alongside the road, tossing it out behind their houses or into the streets in a half-hearted disposal effort. While this may be shocking to hear, it is important to understand that there are not many alternatives available. I saw few bins out in public spaces for collecting trash, and there were even fewer bins were designated for recycling. We take for granted that the recycling truck shows up fortnightly and that the water from the tap does not make us sick. Yet so many places in the world lack the basic infrastructure to supply these necessities of life - this conversation extends way past just Indonesia. The average person probably does not frequently reflect on the fact that having access to a bin is a privilege, but in countries such as the US this privilege is a reality.

Indonesia is a stunningly beautiful place. I mean real jaw-dropping picturesque landscapes that you can’t stop gawking at even after twenty minutes of perplexed observation. The place is a National Geographic photographer’s field day, if you will. But in this experience of nature lies an interesting paradox, that I still don’t quite know how to process and make sense of - these same absolutely incredible views are quickly spoiled when a closer glance is taken. Beaches are littered with straws, bottles, fishing nets, packaging, you name it. When I was swimming with the manta rays in the open ocean, I felt dwarfed by the immensity of both, almost in a sense of isolation from earth, floating on a completely different world. But then you catch a plastic bag floating by out of the corner of your eye, and you realise that it is not just you and the infinite, pure ocean after all. It is perplexing to be among such natural grandeur and then joltingly be reminded of human environmental degradation. 

How are we to move away from single use plastics when there are places that exist where a dependency on plastic equates to survival? In the US we have the choice to do the right thing for the environment and opt for a refillable bottle rather than grab a plastic one from the cooler. What does one do if this option fails to exist?

Surely this seems like a hopeless issue. But I also find motivation in the conundrum. I now see my role more closely as a place of privilege – I have the option to make choices that can benefit the environment. I have the ability to make intentional selections regarding my environmental footprint and on how I choose to live my life because of the country that I reside in. This is something that we should all fully use to our advantage, whether it is as simple as a reusable water bottle or as complex as taking your home power off the energy grid. It is a lesson that while you may not be able to alter the course of the world, or how a government runs its country, or the environmental practices of another culture — these issues aside, you can take someone else’s spot and do the right thing for the environment in a situation where they may not even get the choice. So maybe, in simpler words, this sheds light on our ability to make impactful and sustainable choices on behalf of those who don’t even get the option in the first place.
