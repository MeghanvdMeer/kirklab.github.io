What is the most effective way to spread a message that you hold near to your heart? Is it to share the facts with anyone who will listen, or is it best to step outside of your comfort zone and channel your cause through another medium in hopes of generating a more diverse audience?

Most of us receive messages about climate change from media sources that follow the trail of new scientific information as it is published by the academic community. Take the IPCC reports for example – each time a new report is generated and subsequently released to the public, commentary around the newly calculated climate predictions suddenly springs up and fills the air. Phrases and key thresholds are taken from the reports and used in news sources, and as this information trickles down through the masses the world catches on rather quickly in being able to reiterate its summary. Yet, the follow up conversation that unfolds always seems to recognize that society is not doing enough to remediate environmental issues – whether it be as small as the preservation of a species in threat of going extinct, or as daunting as the entire climate change conundrum. Is it possible to alter this initial interception of information in order to mobilize greater change?

Science communication plays a  prominent role in educating society on the breadth of topics that we strive to understand about our world. Current research and findings of universities are largely made available to the public, and scientific journals provide us with a wealth of knowledge on topics spanning from compilations of genomes to next generation artificial intelligence technologies to carbon cycling models (the area that I am extra enthusiastic about!). Yet this same bank of ideas is tricky to fit within a mold that communicates an accessible and understandable message to people other than the experts who conduct the investigations. In science, once findings are concluded and knowledge is published, it is equally important that the novel  information is impactfully disseminated and distributed out to the people of the world. After all, all people are or will be effected by what lurks in the wake of a changing climate; by the nature of it, this conversation must involve everyone.  

I feel that there must be an urgency in continuing to find ways to express the need for a connection and dependence on the natural world on a more localized scale – something that will resonate with people who think in all different ways and perceive effective communication differently.

For the past two weeks of the my research project, my perceptions of creative communication in climate change have been broadened by speaking to our project’s resident artist. Donna Davis is an Australian native who works in art-science, depicting elements of the natural world through the use of her artistic creativity. Donna creates images and structures that are inspired by her surroundings, and her projects have used organisms such as fungi and termites to paint a picture that overlaps art, local communities, and science. Her stories and accounts of past projects have changed the way I think about communicating bits and pieces of the environmental conservation message. Donna masterfully uses art to bring attention to biodiversity issues, climate change, and the little things in nature that may be overlooked when broader strokes are taken. 

Bringing creativity into the conversation around climate change may be essential in widening people’s response to its urgency. There is only a small fraction of people who will appreciate a message embedded within a Nature journal article  – rather, it may be best to reach people’s sense of responsibility and pique interest by spreading the facts of climate change through unique forms - perhaps more from mediums such as art, music, and entertainment.

Stay tuned for a closer segment on Donna’s work and her perspective on manifesting what she has learned from her art, the environment, and interactions with other artists and the scientific community along the way into her everyday life that she shares with friends and family. And in addition, I challenge you, the reader, to reflect on the creative pockets in your own life, and the potential to pair this aspect of your character with the environmental passions that you have. Who knows, maybe you have the hidden ability to educate or share with others about climate change or environmental preservation in an engaging, relatable way. After all, only positive things can stem from being a catalyst of new conversation!

If you would like a preview of Donna’s work, explore her [blog](https://donnadavisartist.weebly.com/) and the vast topics that she covers through different projects. You may learn a thing or two about symbiosis between species and environments of the world, but through a unconventionally creative lens.
