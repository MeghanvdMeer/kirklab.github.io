Our most recent crumb collaboration is with Becca Clement, a PhD student at George Washington University. Becca studies termite diversity, and one of her current scientific endeavors is a research project in northern Australia studying these fascinating little critters. I had the chance to work with Becca last summer on the Australia project, where she taught me everything about termites and inspired me with her always-positive attitude, themed playlists in the car, and love for making desserts. Now, I have the privilege to keep working alongside Becca as a fellow PhD student this coming fall term.

But back to Becca and her bugs. It was so great to catch up, hear about her path through the world of science, and get some insight on how she sees herself as a scientist within the broader stage of sustainability. Catch up on our chat below!

**Q: What is your background in studies and science? How did you get involved with studying termites?**

Growing up, I didn’t think of myself as a bug person. My freshman year at BYU I chose to do chemical engineering, partly because I have always been concerned about the environment, but also because I was good at math and science. I thought I could work at a power plant or find a better way to source energy to make a difference in the world.

I realized after my first year of engineering that I didn’t enjoy the process of learning about heat transfer, chemistry, and so on. I ended up taking a class in my second semester that combined biology, history and writing. We travelled all over the state of Utah, learning about the history and biology at each stop along the way, and we would then write about our experiences.

This class was a different experience from everything else in engineering, and it was the first time that I met my bug professor, Riley Nelson. His opinion on the world was that we should always have a sense of wonder at everything we looked at. I loved this way of thinking. He took the class to a stream and taught us to see more than just the water and rocks and plants flowing through. He taught us to inspect the rocks; in picking up rocks and turning them over, we found a hidden world of insects living underneath. I loved that sense of wonder, and decided to change my major to biology, realizing learning about these hidden worlds was my true interest.

I got my start working with the bug professor in his lab. The first project we worked on was doing a BioBlitz at Great Basin National Park in Nevada, where for 48 hours straight we collected as many flies as possible. My job was to look at these flies under the microscope and identify them, which was frustrating at the beginning. Eventually the characteristics began to stick and the different families of flies became recognizable. All of a sudden, I would see a fly, look under the microscope, and say to myself, “this is an anthomyiidae because it simply just looks like an anthomyiidae.”

Later on in undergrad, a friend and I attended an informational session for international internships, motivated by the fact that free donuts were available to those in attendance. During the final presentation, a professor pitched a project in Brazil studying dragonflies. My friend Sam and I ended up getting the spot on this project, so off to Brazil we went.

We did a lot of molecular work, extracting DNA from dragonflies and doing PCRs and sequencing. During that trip, we went to the Atlantic rainforest to collect little red damselflies. Being in the rainforest was just amazing. There was so much life, so much insect life, so many things I have never seen before. It was similar to the experience I had with the insects in the stream – there was this whole other world that I had never thought of, so much life that I had no idea about. I think it was that moment in the rainforest that I decided I was fine being a bug lady.

Then I went on to grad school, because I had fun in the lab and wanted to keep studying insects. After some time brainstorming what my project would look like, I was approached by Dr. Amy Zanne who invited me to work on a termite project in Australia with her. It turns out my childhood dream was becoming a scientist in Australia, so I was sold.

I hadn’t thought much about termites before this project – termites are kind of small, they don’t fly, and in terms of insect cuteness at first I didn’t find them very cute. But the more I learned about termites and how cool they were, the cuter they became to me. Working with Amy was a positive experience, we worked well together, and developed a PhD project based off of the Australian termites and there you have it – that is how I ended up as the termite person.

**Q: What is your perspective on sustainability as a scientist in an ecological field? What have you seen from your scientific community that you either commend or would like to see change? **

Originally, I went into science because I care about the environment. But then you find out that even though scientists care about the environment, there are some things that seem to be at a crossroads with each other. For example, although I love insects, I have had to collect and kill many of them for research projects. This can be really hard.. We find ways to justify it – insects lay many eggs and we are only collecting a few so the damage to the community is likely small. But to look an insect in the eye and then place it into a vial of alcohol is still challenging. For the most part, entomologists (scientists who study insects) are very respectful, and collect insects only if they have a purpose, and there are a lot of efforts to collect less destructively. We collect them to understand them, so that we can preserve them, but it can be hard to see the bigger picture in the midst of it all.

Even in setting up field experiments – I would tie pink flagging around trees to remember where plots were, but in the back of my head I would be thinking “this is sort of like littering”. Ideally, everything that is put out into the field for an experiment comes back in when the study is over, but I have seen many instances where flagging or other materials get lost in the forest or are left out in the study area.

It’s also interesting working in a molecular lab when you see how many plastic pipette tips you have to use to do a DNA extraction. At home, I try to avoid buying things with too much plastic packaging, but then at work I have to go in and use hundreds of boxes of pipette tips. That’s a challenge for sure.

Sustainability is the bigger picture. As biologists, we are trying to understand and document nature so that we can protect it and truly know what it is. I do wish that there were ways to do that without being destructive, and I think slowly we are . Anyone who is in the field of sustainability experiences this frustration of the fact that we can never be truly zero waste. That can be daunting, but I think the direction you are heading is very important – even if where you are isn’t perfect, setting a goal and working in that direction can be really fulfilling.

**Q: Talk about some of your own personal sustainability habits and challenges. Are there any things that you have committed yourself to doing for the environment?**

I consider myself a 6/7th vegetarian. A few years ago, I wasn’t a vegetarian, because I like things like orange chicken and pepperoni pizza and an occasional steak. Learning about how bad meat was for the planet, I would say to myself “I should probably be a vegetarian”, but then I would come back to the thought of how tasty orange chicken and pepperoni pizza can be.

So, I decided I would go vegetarian for 6 days a week, so that there would be one day a week where I could have meat if I was really craving it. I’m a proponent of this 6 days a week as a vegetarian method because it gives me the flexibility that makes my goals achievable without necessarily taking away all of my joy. As I have gone on, eating meat has become less frequent, as I find myself eating it on average probably less than once a week.

I also try and use my metal straw when I remember to bring it, but more often than not it is usually easy enough to drink something without a straw altogether. For lunch events with grad students where paper plates and plastic cutlery are found, I always try my best to bring along my own fork and plate. Sometimes it is hard to see if this is really making a difference though, because the single use items that you refuse will probably end up being thrown away in the end.

I try to avoid Styrofoam, but especially with COVID where we all have been doing more takeout food, so it’s more difficult to avoid than normal.

My most recent lifestyle change is that I began composting. I noticed how I was taking out the trash, and how it always seemed to be majority filled by things like banana peels and rotten vegetables. With composting, it is fun to know that I am not producing as much ‘garbage’ trash. I have found a local community compost that is nearby and super convenient. Finding out about community resources like that can be really uplifting, just to know that there are others in the area that have similar goals as you do.

{Side pitch: Becca has a fantastic veggie burger blog where she reviews different restaurants’ recipes (mainly in DC) and gives her official ratings. Check those recommendations out [here](https://dcveggieburgers.blogspot.com/).}

**Q: How do you hope to see your work in your PhD change the world for the benefit of the environment? What changes do you want to see?**

One of the things that drew me to studying insects was to give a voice to these small beings that most people aren’t listening to. That is one of the core things about being an environmentalist, speaking up for and defending the environment. It has been an interesting time to think about sustainability and science within the context of Black Lives Matter and other marginalized groups. I hope that the difference that I can make is to speak up for the insects, but also someone who stands up for the underdog in any kind of situation.

It can get discouraging at times, being just a single person in a world where change seems to happen on behalf of the people who have money. But what I do have is a voice, and I hope that I won’t be afraid to speak up. When I first came into science, I didn’t have many women PhD scientist role models, and so I wanted to be a voice for women in science.

I think there is a lot we can learn from articles that discuss the overlap of racism and environmentalism. I never realized that so many ideas behind environmentalism came from really racist people or had racist ideas embedded. In order to really save the planet, we need to be thinking about everybody. We are not just saving the planet so that people in social and economic power can live comfortably – we all need the planet. Looking out for the planet is essentially looking out for each other.

Can one person even make a difference? I don’t know. Maybe not. Maybe all that I will be able to do is persuade one person to go into science. And maybe that is enough to begin to make the world a better place.

**Q: What is your favorite insect?**

Dragonflies, specifically Anax junius, or the common green darter.
