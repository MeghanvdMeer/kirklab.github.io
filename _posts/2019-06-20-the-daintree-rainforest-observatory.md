This summer I have the good fortune to join a National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program in Queensland, Australia headed by Amy Zanne of George Washington University. In this project, our research questions look to explore the dynamics of nutrient circulation within forest systems, particularly carbon dioxide and methane. So far, we have been studying the decomposition components of forested lands by measuring gas flux of decaying woody plant material. This research has prominent implications in atmospheric modelling, as it adds more accurate and key representative dimensions to Global Climate Models (GCMs). This assists in providing realistic mathematical interpretations of forests and overall more reliable future predictions of a world with different degrees of climate change. 

Few dimensions are considered in current forest carbon models, which in turn does not account for full complexity. In an elementary way, forests can be thought of as carbon sinks, as vegetation of the understory all the way up to the canopy takes up carbon dioxide through the process of photosynthesis. However, this interaction is not the only pathway of such ecosystems – decomposition of plant biomass contrasts vegetative growth and occurs simultaneously as forest development persists. The important considerations lie in process of respiration, as this has equal associations of carbon dioxide being released into the same atmosphere from where it was removed by photosynthetic means. 

In our project, we are looking to better understand the relative roles of fungi and termites in the decomposition gas fluxes of multiple field sites and climate conditions within Queensland. These sites are set along a precipitation gradient to account for the effect of varied rainfall and environmental accommodation of different species. The Daintree Rainforest represents the most extreme rainfall site on the precipitation gradient, recording 4,500 - 5,500 ml of rainfall a year, and this is the first field site that I have conducted research it with the REU team. 

The Daintree Rainforest Observatory (DRO) is an entirely off-grid scientific research facility that is tucked away in Daintree Rainforest, serving as the home base for the first field site of our data harvest collection. This ecosystem is thought to be the oldest rainforest in the world, and it houses a multitude of scientific experiments and ground-breaking findings. The vast biodiversity of the tropics is incredibly important to study in the context of climate change, as concepts such as thermal maximum thresholds and alterations to local climate conditions have the potential to significantly reorganize tropical biospheres.

The DRO is an incredible establishment from both a research and sustainable building perspective. The facility has its own wastewater treatment plant, composting system, and solar-powered grid / generator system. The property houses wet and dry lab spaces, student accommodations, research accommodations, amenity buildings, and even a 50-meter canopy crane that can transport scientists above the tree canopy to study more than just forest floor processes. All of this is powered by the sun – which is absolutely remarkable! And appropriate too, because while most of the research groups working within the DRO have varied scientific inquiries, the common thread of preserving the precious rainforest ecosystem remains.

On my first day at the DRO, my induction leader put it quite simply: “Our system here is self-contained and sustainable – and it’s not too complex. I don’t understand how the rest of the world has not caught on to its simplicity yet”. Oftentimes in my classes back in Cornell, our conversation raises the question of what parties are most influential in instilling large-scale adjustments to the infrastructure of an environmentally-harmful society. Should government lead the shift from conventional to green cities and make vast investments or initiate stricter building codes with environmental considerations? Or does the problem lie in the hands of universities and institutions of higher knowledge, as they have the capacity to lay the bricks to a sustainable future through active research and development projects?

I am not quite sure what the answer is to this predicament, but I can say that conducting research out of the DRO knowing that its environmental impact is minimal was rewarding and has made the research on climate change even more meaningful. The DRO fantastically marries the desire to learn more about our natural environments with courteous conservation and low anthropogenic impact living. Looking to the future, this research facility sets an impressive precedent for how scientific endeavors should be carried out, as well as a model for how cities and residential areas can begin to transition to higher degrees of sustainability.
