Our first feature on Crumb Collabs is Grace Smith, a long-time friend who works in Yellowstone National Park as a biological science technician. Grace and I share many incredible memories as teammates on Cornell’s track team and as members of the Environmental and Sustainability Science undergraduate program. Grace has always been an outdoor enthusiast, and her current job out in the stunning wilderness of Yellowstone sure does suit her well.

I caught up with Grace a few days ago and asked her some questions about her position in Yellowstone, what it is like to work in a protected environmental space, and some of her sustainability tips and tricks – enjoy!

## **Abbey: What is a day in the life of Grace?**

**Grace**: Well, to start, coffee is my favorite part of the morning. Actually, my favorite part of the morning is walking to work with my coffee mug, fully in fear that an elk will approach me and I will drop my mug and break it. I absolutely know that I can mitigate this risk by using a travel mug, but you know, I just can’t make the switch.

(Side note, in undergrad Grace taught me that carrying a normal mug around campus with coffee / tea was the way to go. It made for such a better experience than drinking out of a travel mug. Real mugs have character. To this day, I am a proponent of the normal mug over travel mug lifestyle, no matter the risks or dangers of spilling. It is still worth it even knowing that one day it will shatter, in public, and cause a WHOLE scene.)

One part of my job is the behind the scenes work that makes for safe experiences for park visitors. Lately, we have been doing a lot of hazard tree removal, so I have been cutting down a lot of trees. We make sure that wherever campers are sleeping, there are no imminent threats of giant trees about to fall on them. Even though the task is not particularly glamorous, it is necessary: a tree falling on you while camping would certainly not make for fond memories in Yellowstone.

I am also making the transition to working more with wildlife biology and wildlife management. In Yellowstone, every major wildlife group has a crew (such as the wolf crew, bear crew, fish people, ungulate crew). There is a bird-focused crew within the park that I have been volunteering some time with and learning a lot from. I assist them with whatever project needs they have, and the scope is pretty wide. For example, we have done some work with Golden Eagles, which have been a stunning organism to observe to say the least.

## **A: What is it like to live in a national park?**

**G**: I started in Yellowstone right after graduation last year, so I officially hit one year not too long ago, and it has been an unparalleled experience. The pros of living in the park: you literally live in the park. Some of the most incredible preserved areas in this country make up your front yard. I have the luxury and freedom to explore this every single day, whereas visitors have to strategize to see everything in just one week (or however long their visit is). I am able to get a more intimate feeling of the surrounding nature, I have huge flexibility to see any spectacle at pretty much any time, and also have the ability to find beauty in the little things (outside of the main tourist attractions, that is).

I live with some of the most incredible wildlife, and this has given me a newfound appreciation for these species. I now understand the fascination that people have with buffalo and elk, for example, but also I am able to better understand the dangers that habituation poses for both the animal and the ecosystem as a whole. Hence the importance of my role in the park service, making sure that people are not endangering themselves or the wildlife.

I live in Mammoth which is both the headquarters for some park operations as well as a relatively accessible spot in the park, and this is a bit of a downside because visitors are always abundant. Sometimes visitors are in my backyard for a picnic, so you lose a bit of privacy by living where I do. There are informational signs up by my house, or sometimes a walking tour will pass right by, or sometimes people will go to jail (yes, there is a jail in Yellowstone) and that is right by my house. So just generally, a lot of people coming through my yard, so it is not always peace and serenity.

Managing visitors and their not-so-informed decisions can also be a downside. Some people try to look inside of Old Faithful or pet a bison – it is bewildering what some visitors will do. A couple years ago, we had someone put a [baby bison in their car](https://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/man-who-put-yellowstone-bison-calf-in-suv-gets-probation/article_974ced2b-e323-5ba5-a9c5-ce2a2dc70848.html) because they thought it was cold. Not too smart or an accurate view of what the baby bison needed at the time. Additionally, I have learned that people really don’t understand that ungulates are dangerous. I mean nobody is particularly scared of deer, but deer surely can pose a threat.

## **A: What are some of the sustainable life tips that you live by?**

**G**: Well, I love my Co-op. It’s about an hour and a half drive away in Bozeman, so I usually pair other errands with a big Co-op run. Also, we have a really awesome composting system going in the park. It’s great that we have this resource because composting was pretty accessible in college and I didn’t like the idea of letting that habit go when I moved out here. But luckily I didn’t have to!

I have become more involved with our local community and local agriculture; my roommate and I recently signed up for a CSA (community supported agriculture) share, and we just got our first box last Tuesday – we have such incredible produce right now, and it makes me excited to learn how to cook with veggies I have little experience with! I’ve never had chard in my life, and we got the biggest bag of chard in last week’s share and I was like “here we go!”. I also get fresh eggs from my boss, and I love my happy chickens. My meat consumption is way down, but when I do buy it I look to purchase local game (a couple pounds of elk has been acquired for this year) from local markets.

One thing that is great about living remotely is that there are no real options to be a commercial consumer. Unless I am in Bozeman, there’s no stores around. And if I am shopping in Bozeman, it’s usually at a second-hand gear store or at the REI Co-Op. Generally, I have to think a lot harder now about how I plan my meals and run errands because things are a bit of a drive away. I don’t just willy-nilly drive to Bozeman, and I really think about the impact of how much driving I am doing. It’s a lot of waging: do I want to go to Bozeman and see a movie (probably not) or do I want to drive to go backpacking (I would much rather spend my time that way).

## **A: Has working in the park changed the way that you see human and nature interactions?**

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/pics/yellow4.jpeg

**G**: Yes. I think the park allows people to connect more with their public land and nature in general. Sometimes I see some developments here at first as a little too commercial, but I am then humbled by the fact that my body is able to go do backcountry and crazy hiking adventures. This land shouldn’t just be for people who can access the parks in that off-the-grid way.

The park has this cool combination of being inclusive while also giving people the option to disappear and connect deeper. Some people from the cities come to Mammoth hot springs and it’s just the most amazing thing they have seen in their lives – it is so cool to watch people in that sort of amazement. You can just see the joy in people’s eyes and it’s very, very cute – watching a geyser go off, or people watching the baby animals and freaking out. I love this ecosystem so much. I can’t go anywhere else.

That is what makes the parks unique in comparison to Forest Service land or wildlife refuges, as the parks are more accommodating for people. As much as I might bash on the hotels or the campgrounds or the AirBnBs outside the park, I think they are important because they give all sorts of people the opportunity to come here and appreciate the land that is protected for them.

## **A: Just as a fun fact about you, what is your favorite bird?**

**G**: In general, I have a strong connection with red-tailed hawks because they were the first birds that I significantly watched at Cornell. And I realized, “woah, this is something people do, they look at birds”. In Yellowstone, at the banding stations my favorite bird to hold is a [pink-sided dark-eyed junco](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Dark-eyed_Junco/media-browser/66115751), because they are so soft and very fluffy and really just gorgeous.

Catching up with Grace and talking about her experience with wilderness and human-nature interactions made me want to pack up the car and head out west, pronto. I hope her story inspires you to do the same, or at least explore the natural spaces that are local to you! 

Thank you Grace for your national park stories and inspiring perspective on life in general. In her words, “if you live in Yellowstone, how can you be in a bad mood here!?”. From her pictures alone, I cannot help but agree - how great it must be to live among such nature!

Cheers,
