Great to have you here! After finishing the first year of my PhD, I figured it was time to put together a personal website to share my research and science interests. I hope you find what you are looking for, and please do not hesitate to reach out and [contact me]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/contact.md) with any comments or questions.
