Plastic waste contributes an overwhelming amount to pollution world-wide, and it is a well-established fact that single use plastics comprise up to 40 percent of this waste. People usually associate single use plastics with items such as food packaging, drinking straws,  shopping bags, etc. – however my scientific research involvement this summer has shed a light on another prominent source of short-lived plastic pollution. No matter the means by which it was created, plastics have an almost infinite lifetime and as pollutants of our oceans and lands. 

Recently I dove into data collection for my own research project, which is focused on the role of decomposing wood on the forest floor in carbon cycling and vegetation respiration fluxes. I have noticed that using single use plastics while orchestrating a self-developed project instills lots of environmental guilt. In all my experimentation, I have to take ownership for the materials and resources I use – after all, I am the mastermind behind the experiment – for better or for worse. So, without further ado, let me introduce you to some of the single-use-plastic-players that have a role within my research and laboratory settings.

**Nitrile gloves**

Lab gloves are always used in a disposable and frequent manner – nine times out of ten I have  found the shelves within a lab to be stocked with boxes of these gloves, of all different sizes, boasting their single-use glory. Nitrile gloves are incredibly ~handy~ for situations where sampling must be kept sterile, and our research team relies on gloves for processes such as DNA extractions and enzyme analysis. Sterile conditions are essential for these processes to eliminate contamination, and for our DNA and enzyme data processing I must have gone through fifteen pairs, at least, over the course of a few days. 

While not technically a plastic, nitrile is a synthetic polymer that is claimed to be biodegradable, yet it takes ages to break down. It is derived from the rubber tree, so the quick-use turnover and constant need for replacement naturally stress the landscapes in which the tree is cultivated. So what is the solution? Well, I have found that TerraCycle, a global leader in finding solutions for ‘hard-to-recycle materials’, has a program for lab gloves – which is awesome! Unfortunately, I have never been in a lab that took part in this recycling program, and program restrictions disallow “any gloves that have been in contact with any substances classified as toxic, infectious, pathogenic, flammable, reactive, corrosive, ignitable or radioactive”. Which, depending on what is being studied, could render the program significantly less effective. TerraCycle has heaps of cool initiatives and does an excellent job in fulfilling its mission to recycle the hard to recycle – from dental hygiene products to contact lenses, visit [this page](https://www.terracycle.com/en-AU) to find out more!

**Sandwich bags**

Plastic bags are truly never ending! This one may come as a surprise, but plastic bags are commonly used in data collection and temporary housing of samples. In my research project I transport samples of wood from field sites back to the campus laboratory in plastic zip bags to maintain a stable environment that essentially freezes the respiration and decomposition state of the sample. My goal is to reuse the bags that I have already put to use for my next data collection, but two uses over one still does not right the wrongs of what that plastic will do to the environment once discarded. It is quite the predicament, because in theory I could transport my samples in glass or reusable plastic containers, however given the number of wood blocks that are necessary to take back, space would quickly become an issue. This struggle proves to me that zero-waste science, under the status quo, is nearly if not completely impossible.

**Plastic wrap**

This is one that may come as a surprise, however I have found use in plastic cling wrap for volume measurements. Simply put, my respiration analysis requires an understanding of sample volume, yet the samples cannot absorb water or else the volume by displacement will be inaccurate. Therefore, if the sample is tightly wrapped in plastic and then submerged, an accurate recording can be reached. I have found consolation in being able to reuse each sheet for multiple measurements, however now I understand that the ‘clingy’ property of plastic cling wrap applies mainly when water is not part of the picture – but nonetheless I am reusing the best that I can.

**Pipette Tips and Test Tubes**

Pipette tips and test tubes are a prominent source of single use scientific plastic waste, again due to the necessity of a sterile workspace. Pipette tips are used to transfer one substance to the next, and they are almost always immediately disposed of to avoid contamination. The same goes for test tubes – if samples are sent off for sequencing or further testing, the components are removed and the tube is promptly discarded. Pipette tips are able to be autoclaved, a form of heat and pressure sterilization (and ironically an energy intensive process), however in my experience this has not been a common laboratory practice. It takes extra effort and planning to clean and sterilize these tools, and consistent with other single use plastics, they are in high abundance and inexpensive. 

Single use plastics have us cornered. They are everywhere in everyday life occurrences, and then they show up again in spheres that indirectly impact everybody’s life – such as in science or in medicine, just to name a few. How do we strike a balance between single use plastics that are easily avoidable (cutlery, packaging, etc.) and those that are not so easily replaced, whether it be any of the above examples or another complex plastic conundrum? Should we favor sectors such as academia and consider the use of plastics more permissible, or should we crack down over all sectors equally? The more I think about this the more I realize how challenging it is to decide what are the ‘acceptable’ forms of pollution, if this is even a valid concept.

So my conclusion is this –  science is full of hypocrisy. I am studying the effect of deadwood in forests on carbon cycling in vegetative systems, yet all of the resources that I have used to investigate this question have required some form of carbon to make. In order to study how carbon cycles in forests and the future effects of climate change on these systems, I myself am adding carbon emissions to the atmosphere with each experiment I do. All of science is doing this – research has a particularly heavy resource-dependence, even though it works toward the common goal of better understanding of our world and mitigating our negative influences. But at what cost? The plastic paradox is very much so alive in the conversation around single use plastics in scientific research. Indeed, the scientific industry is a community where environmental degradation is both the motivator and the consequence of combative initiatives.
