You can hardly talk about food without some acknowledgement of the abundant plastic waste that results on its behalf. According to the EPA, an estimated 23% of plastic entering the waste stream results from food packaging and containers. It is clear that recycling programs are simply not a strong enough effort to halt this constant stream of pollution. 

It is true that plastic packaging came about with good intentions: the additional barrier protects against invasions from food-borne pathogens, reduces damage in product transportation, and has been shown to extend shelf life, thus reducing food waste (in a perfect system).  Yet we know that even in the wake of these benefits, plastic packaging results in tons upon tons of pollution that is continuously piling up. 

Removing plastic from your diet can prove to be quite difficult – there are some products that are nearly impossible to find unpackaged! However, one challenge that I like to give myself is to create a ‘low waste footprint meal’. So, if you are up for the challenge, keep reading along, and I will give you hints for a great starter plastic-free meal – tacos!

*Disclaimer* Plastic-free / low waste meals take much more time and planning than a quick TV-style dinner. So make sure to plan ahead, especially when prepping the beans for this particular recipe. The enjoyment manifests both the cooking and sharing of the meal, so get some friends together and make an evening out of it!

Here is the shopping list for my favorite homemade veggie tacos:
* Pinto beans
* Garlic
* Flour
* Salt
* Red onion
* Avocado
* Black olives
* Tomato
* Lime
* Salsa
* Cheese (regular OR vegan, whichever you please)

Great news: pretty much everything on this list can be purchased without plastic. For the beans, I usually pick these up from the local bulk store with reusable containers. They then can be soaked, simmered, combined with garlic and seasonings to taste, and mashed up to create refried beans from scratch. I highly recommend following [this recipe](https://houseofyumm.com/homemade-refried-beans/) to start out.

While you’re at it, stock up on all-purpose flour from the bulk store and get ready to make some homemade tortillas! I personally LOVE making tortillas – simply mix together some flour, water, salt, and a little olive oil (for the flavor, if you would like), form a dough, and then knead out flattened rounds. My go-to recipe can be found [here](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/homemade-tortillas/). I like to make thicker tortillas because I am a fan of a more doughy texture, and going homemade gives you the option to experiment with your preferred tortilla style. These can be cooked over low heat in a frying pan for a couple minutes on each side, until ideal crispy-ness is reached!

For all of the produce on this list (minus the olives), I have been able to find package-free options. Make sure to bring along your produce bags when looking for these items! Produce bags are one of my favorite ways to cut down on plastic waste – they are just like reusable shopping bags, but a bit tinier and more versatile. There is a large assortment of produce bags on the market, but I have also found success in making my own cloth bags and in repurposing other small bags that I randomly acquire. In fact, the produce bags that I use most frequently were originally part of a sheet set that I bought a while ago. The sheets came packaged in a cute cloth bag, and now they are put to use transporting mushrooms and carrots from store. Sometimes it helps to get a little creative and crafty in your thinking!

I will admit that olives are a challenge. I usually buy a little tin of black olives from the store, and while the packaging is not plastic, the aluminum can is not the best thing for the environment either. However, I recently discovered a Mediterranean olive bar at my local Wegmans shop where you could bring your own container, so I will have to give that a go the next time that tacos are on the dinner menu.

Salsa is fun and super easy to make – just dry roast some tomatoes and then toss it in a food processor with some onion, garlic, and some chiles depending on the amount of heat your tastebuds can tolerate. If homemade salsa intimidates you, you can pick up a premade glass jar of salsa and then repurpose the jar for bulk food store trips or as a flower vase for your kitchen table centerpiece!

Cheese is the last item on the list, and sadly I have yet to find it in a plastic free form — this is a tough one. I have a friend who knows how to make homemade halloumi, and my goal is to have her teach me soon. But until then, we are unfortunately stuck with shrink-wrapped cheese from the dairy aisle. I suppose a more accurate title for this article would be ‘Taco Tuesday, (almost) sans plastic. Sorry guys, I have mislead you a tiny bit.

The lesson to be learned is that with a bit of searching and strategic planning, your efforts can go a long way in reducing plastic waste. By incorporating produce bags into your shopping habits, you can opt out of buying a bag of onions held together by a weaved plastic net. You can make your own tortillas, and I guarantee that they will have more character then the plastic-encased tortilla 12-pack from the grocery shop. And while the cheese may have you thinking that this whole challenge is a failure, this recipe in the majority is able to be prepared without a wasteful aftertaste. That is something to be proud of!

So go forth and create tacos, be mindful of your consumptive habits, and give Taco Tuesday (almost) sans plastic an honest try!

Let me know how it goes, or any solutions you find for the cheese and olive conundrum. Cheers!
