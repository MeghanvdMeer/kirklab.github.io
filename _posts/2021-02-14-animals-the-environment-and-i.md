Welcome back to another installation of Crumb Collabs! This week, we bring to you an interview with Sara O’Malley, a Global Health Masters student at Duke University with a keen interest in ‘One Health’: the intersection of human, animal, and environmental health. Sara is not only a brilliant scientist, but also is one of my greatest pals from my undergrad at Cornell. We were teammates on the track and field team, housemates for two highly memorable years, and the best of friends the whole way through!

I had a really great conversation with Sara, and listening to our recorded interview from my voice memos not only captured my dog’s snoring in the background but also truly got the wheels turning in my head as I pondered large scale, sustainability-knitted global topics. It can be quite daunting – with such a big world, and even larger inequities, how do we piece together environmental, animal, and human needs for a brighter, harmonious future? By no means do we have all the answers pinned down here, but what I do know is Sara sheds some wonderful insight on global health and international development. I learned heaps of new and interesting facts along the way, I share this now with you in hopes that you do too!

**Tell us your story – what is your background, and how has this shaped your interests as you came into studying global health?**

Sara grew up on the prairie, north of Chicago, Illinois. She describes her dad as a ‘big science guy’, so science and the natural world were a common thread throughout her childhood. “Since I was 3 years old, I was convinced I would become a veterinarian”, Sara reminisces. “However, in high school when I went to shadow at a vet’s office, I absolutely hated it!” Sara held on to her keen interest in animals heading into college, but opted for a broader perspective, majoring in biology. “I ended up studying neurobiology, which eventually inspired me to take a course in animal behavior – a topic that I truly enjoyed.”

Sara was not strictly a hardcore science geek – she changed up the pace by taking Spanish alongside her biology-focused curriculum. “I really liked having an outlet from the sciences. It was an interesting contrast to engage in a very literature-arts-romantic world, which was so different from the science world that consisted of grueling courses and general chemistry. Spanish served as an opportunity to turn to my creative side, so to speak.”  Using the right side of the brain every once in a while is definitely not a bad way to spruce things up! 

In addition to learning about the brain and how to conjugate verbs in a foreign language, Sara became inspired by topics in international development. “I loved how my international development courses addressed different, honest perspectives of the world that I had not been exposed to before (such as the harms being done to factory workers and in China) – these discussions got me interested in the idea of human-health intersection.” Sara was particularly interested in the work of Dr. Steve Osofsky, a professor in the vet school who worked on Cornell’s planetary health alliance team. “His studies served as my first true example of One Health,” Sara recalls. “Dr. Osofsky worked with African wildebeests, and during their migration across Africa, they run into the fences that farmers use to raise and corral cattle. The wildebeests cannot get past the fences, and as a result they get stuck there, and die all along the fence. This represents a conservation issue (because the wildebeest population is harmed), and the abundance of carcasses then spurs a human health issue. It is all connected, and this was one of the first inspirations I had in pursuing the idea of One Health in my own career.”

Sara spent the following summer in Portugal in an international internship program, which provided an exciting opportunity to continually pursue topics in One Health, but now from an international perspective. She eventually began looking into graduate programs at Duke and Notre Dame, both of which had strong global health programs. She received a language scholarship from Duke (thanks to all those Spanish classes!), and the rest is history.

**What is One Health?**

One Health is the intersection of human, animal, and environmental health. As Sara puts it, each of these elements exist in the same spaces – humans put animals at risk, animals put humans at risk, humans put the environment at risk, when the environment is harmed it puts humans and animals at risk, so on and so forth. The question is: how do we protect people, animals, and the environment, given that they are all interacting so closely? Sara believes that it is necessary to take a multifaceted approach in looking at global issues – you will not be able to solve a problem of this caliber just by focusing on a single actor in the One Health triad.

Here is an example of One Health in action, from some of the work Sara’s lab is currently involved in. In the Amazon, mining is prominent – sometimes it is illegal, sometimes not, but it happens regardless. Rainforests are cut down in order to mine for gold and precious metals, presenting an environmental issue. In the mining process, mercury is used to purify and separate out the gold, and the mercury is inevitably released to the water and soil, thus serving as a toxin to the trees, fish, and water table. On the human health side, deforestation opens the door to vector species, such as mosquitoes and sandflies, making people sick with diseases such as malaria or leishmaniasis. The mercury bioaccumulates in the fish through time, which consequently makes the whole food chain sick, humans included. Sara’s lab has done a lot of sampling of these interactions in order to get a comprehensive view of all the issues that are being caused by a single action of mining for gold.

**Tell us about the research you are involved with and how it connects to topics in environmentalism and One Health.**

Sara is studying fish hauls in the Amazon and looking to use them as a proxy for malaria risk (fish hauls are defined as the fish that are caught by indigenous populations). “The Amazon River, depending on water height, influences where people go to fish and what fish they catch. With varying river and weather patterns, mosquito movement and reproduction shifts.” Ultimately, the goal is to connect fish haul data to river height data to malaria data to weather data to see if weather and fish hauls can be used as a predictor for malaria risk. Sara explains that this is not such a simple task. “It can be difficult to track indigenous populations in the Amazon due to a lack of technology – but the fish hauls serve as a good proxy for their movements. In addition, a correlation has been observed for certain river events and people’s movements to areas within the Amazon, and the resulting increases in malaria cases.” Considering all of these factors will help Sara to better understand how One Health interactions (human populations, mining disturbance to the environment, and local fish populations) contribute to malaria outbreaks. “Malaria is a treatable disease, but unfortunately not all Latin American countries have access or funds for the necessary treatments, and many people get sick and die as a result. Hopefully, my project will contribute to a better understanding of factors contributing to malaria in the Amazon, as well as increase our understanding of reliable malaria predictors.”

**Are there any personal sustainability goals or habits that you have?**

“I would recommend being conscious of your gold-purchasing decisions, because this is a potential source of negative environmental impact.” More often than not, gold will be the product of unethical methods, and it is really difficult to trace the source of precious metals in general. “A lot of gold mining happens in Latin America, so a gold purchase likely comes from the Amazon basin, where the environmental destruction is occurring,” Sara reports. I looked into it, and there is not a clear way for consumers to trace back where their gold can come from. Additionally, mining booms for gold have ravaged parts of the Madre de Dios, a region in the Peruvian Amazon (which also happens to be where Sara’s specific research is focused). Sara hopes that eventually a standard of reporting gold origins will be organized, but for the time being, decreasing overall demand is the safest option. For more information on Amazon gold mining, I found this informative short video [here](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/environment/video-the-price-of-gold-illegal-gold-mining-in-the-amazon/11114/), which digs into the situation a bit more.

Sara also expressed excitement about recent efforts to get a compost bin for her apartment. She will soon be a member of the Durham composting network, and it’ll be awesome to see this be added to her sustainability repertoire!

Sara’s advice for scientists: “I think it is important for scientists to be in tune with the social side of the research questions they take on. As unfortunate as it is, science does not always have overwhelming power when it comes to making a change in policy or the day-to-day routines of people. Being able to function in these ‘multiple worlds’ is important and makes your message even more powerful.”

**Coda**

All of these comments made my brain hum with questions about how One Health relates to some of our modern pandemic dramas. I asked Sara about her perspective on COVID and One Health, and if she perceives any overlap between the two. “One train of thought suggests that COVID virus originated in a ‘wet market’ in China. Wet markets are on the rise in low- and middle-income countries, and they are typically a rather sustainable way of getting food – the harvests are more small scale, easier for citizens to access, not to mention non-industrial.” However, there are limited health restrictions in wet markets, and this is where diseases such as COVID take the stage. “Ultimately it is a development health issue – we need to find a way for practices like this to go on, because they can be very accessible and sustainable ways of acquiring food for citizens. Plus, as countries develop more, there is usually an increasing desire for meat.”

This is apparently a familiar story, as AIDS/HIV likely originated with bushmeat consumption, and zoonotic (meaning diseases spread between animals and people) viruses have always been around, from the SARS outbreak in 2003 to the not so long ago scares over Ebola Virus. “We have to recognize that things are the way they are for a reason, as infrastructure and public education are usually lacking in the areas where such viruses emerge. The people themselves are poor and desperate – they are just needing to eat what they can, and some costs are simply not a necessity to weigh.” Considering all of these human-environment-animal connections, it is no surprise that Sara predicts One Health to be front and center in our future understanding, prevention, and control of infectious disease.

As we wrapped up our conversation, Sara brought up one last thought-provoking point that I would like to leave with you to ponder. “COVID and Black Lives Matter have become prevalent themes in my coursework. Decolonizing global health is huge, and offering an equitable pandemic response to all members of the global population is needed now more than ever.” A tricky thing about global health is that it is very reminiscent of the colonial era – people with ‘higher knowledge’ enter into a foreign space trying to ‘fix things’, but intentions sometimes go awry. While incredible technological and scientific feats have emerged from countries such as the US and the UK to battle the pandemic, this does not mean the information and technology has a global reach. For some countries, such as India and Brazil, the pandemic is hitting hard, and the vaccines we now have developed in the US will have some trouble circulating to these places. “India and Brazil have the capacity to make the vaccine, but do not necessarily have a vaccine that is savvy enough to be effectively distributed throughout the population. Moderna and Pfizer will likely not share the patent – so these countries will continue to be crippled by the pandemic.”

Canada has purchased somewhere on the order of 5x its population in vaccine doses, and the US purchased 2-4x the population’s need. “Here in the US, the average citizen will likely be able to get the shot before health professionals in low- and middle-income countries. In Africa and some parts of South America, the vaccine will probably not be widely available until 2022 at the earliest, far after we benefit from widespread access in the states.” It is a challenge to see your privilege until you dig a bit deeper and consider the lives of those outside of your normal circles of interaction.

“The Eurocentric vision has historically and continually inferiorized low- and middle-income countries in a very systematic and often intentional way. This has a legacy effect, and I think we will be seeing proof of this as we move through the COVID vaccination process across the globe.”
