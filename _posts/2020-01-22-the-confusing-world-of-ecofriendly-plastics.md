Bioplastic, biodegradable plastic, compostable plastic, recyclable plastic – these words have become all the more common as a recent plastic craze takes the world by storm. This new, confusing, eco-friendly terminology has certainly misconstrued the meaning plastic while simultaneously making it more difficult to dispose of properly. As new types of materials and ‘plastics’ emerge in green marketing and sustainable packaging efforts, what is actually meant by these labels? In this article we will take a closer look at the jargon of ‘greener’ plastic materials and how it all shakes out for conscientious consumers looking to have control over their environmental and pollution footprint.

Plastic, in the simplest sense, is a versatile material sourced from petroleum. This raises some obvious issues, as plastic represents another facet of human life that is chained to fossil fuels. We depend on plastic to fill numerous roles and conveniences of modern living, so much so that Chinonye and I dedicated a blog to investigate its replacements! From water bottles to car parts to phone cases, whether you are a fish or a human, we are all swimming in some sort of  sea of plastic.

Plastic has stolen the spotlight in recent news, as consumers are becoming increasingly aware of its irreversible environmental harm. The immensity of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and photographs of turtles impaled with plastic straws must ring a bell, but the problem carries much further than this. In the US, every day the average person generates [0.34 kilograms of plastic waste](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#which-countries-produce-the-most-plastic-waste). 0.34 kilos per day!  That is ¾ of a pound! Or 3 sticks of butter worth of plastic pollution, per US citizen, per day. That’s 273 pounds of plastic per person PER YEAR, or translated into sticks of butter, 1,095 sticks of butter equivalents of plastic pollution. *This is insane*!

Even worse, this statistic only represents one country out of the whole world, and there are plenty of other plastic-addicted nations. So, it is no wonder that engineers and chemists out there are searching to create alternatives that will not continue to pollute our ecosystems and oceans for centuries to come. Enter, bioplastics. A possible solution (?), along with all of the other seemingly-synonymous alternatives. 

Simply put, a **bioplastic** is a plastic-like material that performs many of the same functions but is derived from plants, mainly corn. Through a succession of chemistry steps, a crop like corn can be turned into [polylactic acid](https://bioplasticsnews.com/polylactic-acid-or-polylactide-pla/) (PLA), which ultimately forms a material similar to petroleum-based plastic. While the general consensus of the topic is difficult to sift through, my research concludes that an industrial composting facility is required to properly break down bioplastic. Under these heat-controlled environments, the process is able to return by-products to the earth in a safe manner.

Contrast this with **biodegradable plastics** – similar name, but this material requires a completely different waste management strategy. Biodegradable plastics are likely to come from both bioplastic (plant-derived) and petroleum origin, which *cannot* be composted alongside bioplastics. Some of the additives in biodegradable plastic allow for the material to break down quicker, however toxic residues may result on behalf of the degradation process. Unfortunately, there is also no guarantee that industrial composting facilities will be able to properly manage biodegradable plastics without contaminating other compost. 

Wow, this is turning out to be really confusing. But wait, there is more!

Let’s get a taste for 2 particular culprits of confusion: the compostable plastic cup and my bean sprouts container. 

**Compostable cups**

These misleadingly plastic-esque cups seem to make an appearance at every environmental-themed guest lecture, conference, or luncheon that I attend. Placed out among the beverage options, these little clear cups with a green band seem to fit the theme of an sustainably-minded event. These cups are most frequently bioplastic and made of PLA, but how do you dispose of them? I have certainly recycled them in the past when no compost bin was available, thinking that was the correct fate for my drink glass. However this *contaminates recycling*, because accepted material must be of petroleum origin in order to be recycled properly. Bioplastics qualify as a #7 recyclable, or ‘miscellaneous’, and only on rare occasions will they be accepted by your local recycling facility. 

I found Eco Products to be a leader in all kinds of ‘sustainable’ cutlery and cup options. In their [FAQ section](https://www.ecoproducts.com/faqs-composting_and_recycling.htm), it is stated that compostable cups and other products are “designed to be composted in commercial facilities, where temperature, moisture, oxygen, and other factors can be carefully monitored”. Again, this goes back to a common theme: compostable bioplastics only work out if the consumer has access to facilities that dispose of containers properly. Which means having sufficient access to commercial composting facilities. Which is problematic, because it is very difficult to determine where these facilities actually are. One solution may be held at the website [Find A Composter](https://findacomposter.com/), but details for each facility are limited and not laid out in a straightforward manner. It seems that while bioplastics are picking up in popularity, waste management infrastructure to accomodate these new materials still lags behind. 

**Bean Sprouts ‘Compostable’ Container**

This one I had to really work for. To make a long story short, there are these delicious, local bean sprouts that I pick up from my  Co-Op that make the perfect sandwich and salad toppers. I picked up a new pack yesterday, and I realized that on the label it reads ‘compostable container’, which coincided perfectly with my bioplastics related research for this article. I got in contact with both the bean sprout farmers and the local composting operation, Cayuga Compost to search for disposal answers. Here is what I found: even though this is a great local product, there is no infrastructure that actually puts this compostable container to work. Cayuga Compost referred me to check with Tompkins Recycling, as their composting facility is unable to accept the plastic ‘compostable’ container. After contacting Recycling and Materials Management of Tompkins County, I found that the sprouts container is essentially a #7 plastic, a category that is not accepted for my local curbside pickup. As far as the compostable claims go, in reality they are empty.

Without a question, bioplastics and compostable plastics are sustainable technologies on the rise and have a vision for a better future. Yet, simply creating these plastic alternatives is not a sufficient solution. The infrastructure counterpart is lacking, and this prevents bioplastics from being properly handled in the waste stream.

Ultimately, in my effort to support local farms and choose packaging that seemed more sustainable, my sprouts container will have to end up in the landfill, for now.

The line between a plastic item disposal destiny in a landfill, recycling plant, or compost facility is quite blurry. From reading numerous articles on the topic and delving into local resources, I have come to the conclusion that the best way to resolve consumer plastic disposal confusion is to investigate on a local level and find out what your local facilities are able to accommodate. 

I deem bioplastic and ‘eco-friendly’ plastic alternatives to be a half step forward, and two steps back. It is a valiant effort to create materials that will stand in the place of petroleum-based plastic, but it is just chipping away at the problem at hand. If we are to truly meet the plastic pollution epidemic head on, we need to reorganize our waste streams and revamp our thinking around waste management, composting, and recycling. On the large scale. Only then can we make real strides in this fight against plastic pollution, without constantly backtracking through the logistical hangups.
