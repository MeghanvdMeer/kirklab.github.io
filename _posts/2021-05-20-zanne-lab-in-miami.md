News and greetings from the sunshine state! The Zanne Lab has officially moved to the University of Miami. This coming fall term, I will be continuing on with the second year of my PhD and exploring my new home in this part of the country. 

So far, there has been lots of sunshine, random rainstorms, lizards, and humidity. In this past week of orientation I have been meeting other graduate students and faculty in the department, and I am becoming more and more excited to connect with folks asking questions about tropical ecology and forest systems. There is lots of fun collaboration on the horizon for sure!

In the meantime, I will be catching up on my Spanish skills from grade school, beginning the fall term, and finishing up a paper. My coursework this fall will be centered around becoming a well-rounded biologist, as I will be studying molecular and cell biology - from genomes all the way to organisms. On the weekends, I hope to explore local beaches and also get out on trips to the Everglades and Big Cypress (completely new ecosystems to me).
