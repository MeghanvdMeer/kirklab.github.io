In celebration of one year with ‘a crumb’ up and running, it is time for a new segment to be added to the blog! I am excited to introduce you all to a new interview-based segment of our blog, titled ‘Crumb Collabs’.

I am certain that over the past couple months we have all dearly missed normal and true social interactions with friends and families. COVID-19 has changed the way that we work, celebrate achievements, and offer love and support to others. In some sense, having social circles limited to those who you live with definitely limits our capacity for having good times and good conversations. Chats over Facetime, Zoom, and Google Hangouts are not quite the same as grabbing a cup of coffee (in a reusable mug of course) with a friend, but they still do have the capacity to bring us closer together in a virtual sense. Yet in truth, even with these wonders of technology I still find myself craving to be in the physical presence of others.

This new adventure with ‘Crumb Collabs’ will take advantage of virtual connection as we remotely interview close friends, family members, and colleagues on their environmental wisdom and sustainability life tips. I for one have had a little bit of trouble motivating myself to be creative and socially active ever since the end of the spring semester, so perhaps this is my subconscious attempt to break out of this cycle. We all have struggles finding our way along the new path of life that this situation requires of us. But hopefully this segment will be a fun piece of light reading to look forward to as the weeks go by. I hope that it continues to expand your repertoire of environmentally-conscious perspectives on your life choices, and maybe even inspire you to build new habits in this slower-paced life.

I really look forward to these reconnections and conversations, and at the end of the day we all have so much to learn from one another. If you would like to share any of your own personal insights or want to volunteer your story for an interview (super informal, of course!) do not hesitate to reach out via the blog email (linked in our contact tab). After all, the more crumb collaborations we have, the better!

Keep an eye out within the next week for our first of many crumb collabs with Grace Smith, a former Cornell Environmental and Sustainability Sciences major and current biological technician out in Yellowstone National Park. 

Cheers!
