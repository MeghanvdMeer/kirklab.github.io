One of the biggest challenges in sustainability is to successfully implement nontraditional, eco-minded practices into a situation which intrinsically resists valuing environmental considerations. On my flight back home to the United States from Australia, I had plenty of time to think about this issue in the context of air travel and experience it firsthand. Simply put, the aviation industry loves single use plastics, and it is hard to convince them to change their ways. 

As discussed, travelling by plane in itself carries a huge environmental weight, and the single use culture of the airline industry only augments to the harm. I have found that for international flights, it is nearly impossible to avoid single use items. From the meal service to plastic-wrapped blankets and pillows, travelling by sky is truly an environmental doozy. There are few alternatives, as you are dependent on what is provided to you, especially for a 14 or 15 hour flight. This represents a double-edged sword: on one hand, airlines have an exciting opportunity to revolutionize air travel as we know it and actively seek out replacements for single use products. However, there exists minimal examples of airlines taking initiative on this front, and it is a relatively unexplored area of improvement. 

So now, I present to you a timeline of my travels, described by my encounters with inevitable plastic waste. We begin in the Brisbane airport on a very happy note – a plastic free breakfast! As your will see, this experience was one of a kind on my journey, and it certainly attributable to the dining experience being within the airport itself, rather than being on board. But what can I say, the avocado toast was spectacular and I couldn’t help but smile while knowing that this was going to be my last guilt-free meal for quite a while.

Next up: the international flight from Brisbane to Los Angeles. As to be expected, my pineapple fried rice dinner was expertly smothered in plastic. I always bring my reusable utensils wherever I go, however upon being handed my tray of food a plastic utensil set was already in place. My hope was that since the packaged cutlery went untouched, it might get a second use. However, I fear that in reality the unopened utensils would be tossed anyways without an intent for reuse. The same goes for the individual butter dish – even though I chose not to open it, there is no guarantee that it was properly sorted out before going into the trash.

I have been on many airlines before that accompany dinner with a hearty bread roll, but this was the first flight where it came prepackaged. I was incredibly disappointed in this choice by Virgin Australia, as it is by far the most unnecessary packaging on the tray. Even though the meal had surprisingly delightful flavor, the environmental harms could not be masked. 

After six or so hours of fidgety and incomplete sleep, I awoke to the faint glow of cabin lights and a general sense of restlessness among the passangers. This could mean only one thing – breakfast would soon be served. With my internal clock confused beyond description, I was welcomed by my third meal of the trip – a bean, potato, spinach, and mushroom breakfast spread. Of course, an entirely new and unopened cutlery pack accompanied the tray by default (it makes you wonder if anyone in the airline executive office ever thought to have customers reuse their forks and knives!). Complete with a cardboard box of raisins (wrapped in plastic for some reason) and a pathetic excuse of a fruit cup, I was once again filled with a sense of guilt for this ridiculously plastic-laden meal.

Throughout the course of the international flight I counted five or six occasions where I was offered a drink in an entirely new cup. Most people do not choose to reuse their first cup – think of how much waste you can generate on behalf of just drinks alone! While I took a gin and tonic in a plastic cup right after takeoff, I quickly remembered that I had packed my travel mug in my carry on. To my astonishment, when I asked the airline staff for refills of tea in my own container, there were no funny glances or looks exchanged. I was pleasantly surprised. 

Once arrived in LAX, I endured a long layover only to discover that a departure delay would render my subsequent connections to Ithaca unreachable. Begrudgingly and terribly jet lagged, I stayed the night in Los Angeles while I waited for the next flight available. My next meal came on behalf of a Delta Airlines food voucher, and in a scramble to both get out of the airport and to the hotel to get some (much needed) sleep, this dish was by far the biggest environmental catastrophe.

Plastic wrapped plastic cutlery (for a sandwich – completely unnecessary in the first place!), Styrofoam encasing, and a plastic bag to hold the whole situation together – now this was bad. In reflection, I curse my brain at this moment in time for asking for take-away. I should have just sat at the weird airport bar that I ordered from and eaten my sandwich there. But alas, the time zone confusion and general weariness from my travels got the best of my logical reasoning.

The next day I caught the earliest flight out to Detroit, where I stocked up on panini sandwiches from Starbucks with my remaining meal vouchers. I felt a sigh of relief as the sandwiches were handed over the counter in flimsy paper bags – this had to be somewhat better than all the single use plastic I had churned through thus far. The shorter domestic flights had no meal service, and with a Starbucks muffin in hand I was perfectly equipped to refuse the packaged peanut and pretzel snacks provided on the final leg of my journey. Yet cumulatively throughout my trip, I was responsible for a whole heck of a lot more plastic waste than I would have preferred. 

After reading this extensive account of the almost guaranteed unavoidable plastic catastrophe that flying entails, you may be wondering if there is any hope at all for the industry. However, there have been some airlines that have stepped up to the challenge and implemented small scale change to produce more responsible outcomes. Hi Fly, a Portugese-run airline, piloted the world’s first plastic-free flight  in December of 2018. The company opted for bamboo cutlery, cut back on plastic packaging entirely, and used cups that were plant based and of compostable material.

The president of Hi Fly, Paulo Mirpuri, is quoted as a large proponent of considering the environment in business related decisions and incorporating social responsibility into the root of the airline’s plastic-free campaign. "We know from the feedback we have received from client airlines and passengers, that it’s the right thing for the airline to be doing," Mirpuri said following the plastic free flight trial. "These test flights will prevent around 350kg of single-use, virtually indestructible plastics from poisoning our environment."

In addition, Etihad Airways claimed the world’s longest plastic free flight,  flying from Abu Dhabi to Brisbane strategically on Earth Day of 2019. The airline has ambitious goals for reducing plastic pollution brought about on behalf of in flight service, aiming to show 80 percent reductions by the end of 2022. After this flight, it was determined that 50 kilograms of waste would be diverted from this single journey. Imagine the positive impact Etihad could have on the world if the company operated all of their flights with this environmental conscientiousness!

Numerous other airlines have prioritized future goals involving a more substantial commitment to sustainable operation . Alaska Airlines has cut out plastic straws from their services, and Ryanair has set out to be a leader in sustainable air transportation by eliminating all single use plastics by 2023. Air New Zealand has promoted similar initiatives to slash plastic items on flights, and Delta has expressed interest in following suit as well.  

If this is a trend on the rise, it certainly comes in good time. Air travel is continually becoming more popular as it contributes to the efficiency and interworking of our globalized economy. Although this interconnectedness comes at a clear cost: according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 5.7 million tonnes of single use waste was generated on behalf of the passenger airline industry in 2017. Consistent the theme of many environmental issues that we face, this figure is only likely to substantially expand within the coming years. 

Change always requires a new frontier and a new leader. Through these examples of single-use free flights the airline industry has shown that it is indeed possible - it is clear that now more than ever this operation must become the new norm. If a flight on Earth Day can be run plastic free, what is stopping us from demanding that each day in the year be treated the same way? Removing single use plastics from air travel will surely be revolutionary, and it may alter some of the conveniences that we have received and grown accustomed to in the past. The future is exciting because we get glimpses of it in the present – and then we must strive to make it a reality.
