My blog, titled 'a crumb', will be re-housed in the upcoming weeks to a github page! Previews of my recent posts will be available here, on my personal website, and by navigating over to the a crumb tab you will be able to access the new website in full. Looking forward to revamping the website and catching up on posts from the spring semester. Things have gotten crazy so I have not been up to much writing, but I have a list of topics to explore for this summer, so plenty of writing and sustainability ideas are on the horizon.
