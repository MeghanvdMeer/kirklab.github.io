Forests store carbon in the towering trees that we walk amongst in the woods, but you don't have to only look up to find carbon. At the ground level, soils, accumulated organic matter, and fallen deadwood also stores carbon. However, as these materials break down in the decay process, carbon is released, thus largely moving carbon out of 'terrestrial storage' and into that of the atmosphere. 

I am interested in the dynamics of this carbon balancing process: specifically, how does deadwood decay both through time and across different environmental gradients? Insects and microbes interact with deadwood decomposition, breaking down structural components in order for wood to go from freshly-fallen to spongy and indescernable from the surrounding soils. For this reason, I am also interested in characterizing decomposer communities across temporal and environmental gradients. 

Termites are of particular interest when it comes to deadwood decomposers, especially in tropical systems. Some termites produce methane in addition to carbon dioxide as they break down organic materials, having interesting implications for global methane budgets. Similar to the methanogenic processes occuring in our Earth's wetlands, termites act as a natural source of methane from the land to the atmosphere. During my PhD, I aim to more closely investigate how termites contribute to methane production and wood decomposition in tropical ecosystems. 

My supecific current and ongoing research projects are as follows:
