Forests store carbon in the towering trees that we walk amongst in the woods, but you don't have to only look up to find carbon. At the ground level, soils, accumulated organic matter, and fallen deadwood also stores carbon. However, as these materials break down in the decay process, gaseous forms of carbon are released, thus moving carbon out of 'terrestrial storage' and into that of the atmosphere. 

I am interested in the dynamics of this carbon balancing process: specifically, how does wood decay both through time and across different environmental gradients? Insects and microbes interact with deadwood decomposition, breaking down structural components in order for wood to go from freshly-fallen to spongy and indescernable from the surrounding soils. For this reason, I am also interested in characterizing decomposer communities across temporal and environmental gradients.

Termites are of particular interest when it comes to deadwood decomposers, especially in tropical systems. Some termites produce methane in addition to carbon dioxide as they break down organic materials, having interesting implications for global methane budgets. Similar to the methanogenic processes occuring in our Earth's wetlands, termites act as a natural source of methane from the land to the atmosphere. During my PhD, I aim to more closely investigate how termites contribute to methane production and wood decomposition in tropical ecosystems.

My current and ongoing research projects are as follows:
1. *Deadwood decay through time in upland and lowland forests*: This past summer, I worked at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) in Edgewater, Maryland in a ForestGEO plot to study deadwood decay. In collaboration with Sean McMahon and Amy Zanne, I began to investigate how deadwood transitions in 'decay stage' by both analyzing historical survey data from 2014 and 2017 and contributing to an additional 2021 survey. Additionally, I began sampling greenhouse gas emissions from deadwood at different points along the decay process (spanning freshly fallen to largely deconstructed) to understand the rates and forms of decomposition-associated carbon. In the future, I will sequence the deadwood microbial communities to identify differences in community composition depending on the surrounding environmental conditions (lowland innundated soils vs. upland well drained soils). 

2. *Stem damage across a precipitation gradient in Northern Queensland, Australia*: As a REU student in the summer of 2019, I worked with Habacuc Flores-Moreno to measure internal stem damage of tropical trees across a rainfall gradient in Queensland, Australia. Using a resistograph drill, we were able to examine whether or not trees incurred internal damage (i.e., missing heartwood). We then investigated the predictors of this stem damage (rainfall, DBH, wood density) in order to understand how this changes our understanding of aboveground biomass accounting in tropical forests. Over the spring/summer of 2021, we have been working together with coauthors to finalize our results and write up the manuscript. Stay tuned for a hopeful publication alert in the near future!

3. *Deadwood microbial communities at Tyson Rot Plot*: Working alongside Marissa Lee, I am learning about the DADA2 pipeline to explore uses in examining community composition of deadwood decomposers. We are interested in targeting methanogenic players as well, having implications for how carbon is being released in forest-floor processes.
