title: Outreach

As I continue with my PhD, I am always seeking out science communication opportunities and ways to engage people other than just scientists in my work. It is so incredibly important to make sure that scientific ideas burst out of the academic bubble that they are too often kept. I strongly believe that by dedicating time to outreach and scientific communication, we include new perspectives, consider new vantage points, and make our voices heard by all. Not to mention, it can be loads of fun!

Most recently, Becca and I created a Buzzfeed quiz that determines which termite best represents your personality. We worked together with our termite reading group to make the descriptions and quiz outcomes as accurate as possible, so you are sure to find your true termite twin. Many thanks go out to members of the termite reading group, members of the Zanne lab, and Donna Davis (credit for the above photo) for their photo contributions to the quiz.

## Connecting with Cornell undergraduates on a climate change minor panel. 

At the end of April, I had an opportunity to speak to Cornell undergraduates about my experiences with the climate change minor from my time as a student, as well as how the minor lead into a climate change-focused career. It was great to speak as a recent alumni and offer advice from the academic / PhD track perspective to students interested in the intersection of climate change and earth systems reasearch.
