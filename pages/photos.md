The 17-year cicada emergence in Washington, DC made for an eventful spring in 2021. These cicadas from 'Brood X' have waited underground, quitely feeding on plant roots and waiting for their synchronized emergence as nymphs. Emerged nymphs will ascend tree trunks, shed their exoskeleton, and begin their brief adult life as they search for a mate in the treetops. Fun fact: Brood X is comprised of three different cicada species (*Magicicada septendecim*, *Magicicada cassinii* and *Magicicada septendecula*), all with unique male mating songs!
