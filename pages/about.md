My name is Abbey and I am finishing the first year of my PhD at George Washington University, located in our nation's capitol - Washington, D.C.. I study under the advisement of the incredible Dr. Amy Zanne, investigating global questions in carbon cycling, forest systems, and decomposition. Prior to beginning my PhD at GWU, I earned my B.S in Environmental Science at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, focusing on biogeochemistry and climate change. 

Ithaca is not only the city of my alma mater, but it is also proudly the place that I call home. Ithaca is one of the most beautiful pockets of the world in my (obviously biased) opinion, but if you are ever in the area please reach out so I can give you prime recommendations for where to find spectacular and quaint nature.

Outside of my PhD research, I am an outdoor enthusiast, always looking to explore the best hidden hiking and swimming spots with my dog Zoe (pictured above). I love waterfalls, dogs, and baking bread, but more than anything I love sharing with others my passion for the natural world. Additionally, at Cornell I competed as a varsity student-athlete on the track and field team, specializing in the 400 meter hurdles. After 10+ years of competitive racing, I continue to love running, but have shifted my focus to explore more creative movements in my yoga practice.
