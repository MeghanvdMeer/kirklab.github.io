My name is Abbey and I am a first year PhD student at George Washington University, located in our nation's capitol - Washington, D.C.. I study under the advisement of the incredible Dr. Amy Zanne, investigating global questions in carbon cycling, forest systems, and decomposition. 

My website layout comes on behalf of Millennial, a minimalist Jekyll theme. The purpose of this theme is to provide a simple, clean, content-focused publishing platform for your publication site or blog (not to mention, it's free!). You can find everything you need to get started with this theme under documentation. For more information on how to install and use this theme, check out [the documentation]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2016-10-10-getting-started %}).
